Design Document for uCal

uCalReds class:
	constructor:
		IN: list of baselines, list of frequencies, thresholds
		Out: suitable list to construct uCalibrator class

uCalibrator class
	constructor: 
		IN: give it a grouped list of [[(ant1index, ant2index, chan, u) for all visibilities measuring this u bin] for all u bins]
	create logcal matrices
		IN: nothing
		OUT: A, B
	create noise coveriance matrix
		IN: bandpass, redundancies, 
		OUT: 
	create lincal matrices
		In: initial guesses for beta, sigma, D, noise covariance diagonal
		Out: A, (AtNinvA)^-1

uCalData class
	constructor: calculates visibility averages and stores them as a class object
		IN: data in some reasonable format, uCalibrator object
