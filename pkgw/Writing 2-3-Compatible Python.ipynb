    "One aspect of the issue relates to `repr`. Here's one way to think about it: in 2/3-compatible code, the `repr` of explictly-typed bytes and Unicode depends on which major version of Python you're running. The `repr` of `str`, however is the same.\n",

    "The last line is generally the problem: in Python 3, if you `print` a bytes value, it is stringified, which is equivalent to taking its `repr`, which gives you the value in the  `b''` formatting. Note that if your value was of the `str` type — i.e., either bytes or Unicode depending on the Python major version — everything would be OK. (In terms of unwanted extra characters from the `repr` operation, that is. From a purist standpoint, calling `print()` with non-Unicode is *always* incorrect, hence [pwkit.cli.unicode_stdio](http://pwkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli-tools/pwkit-cli-toplevel/#pwkit.cli.unicode_stdio). It is *very* challenging to write Python code that is truly correct in these matters, though.)\n",

    "More rarely, you'll have the symmetric problem: a function expects `str`, or auto-stringifies a value, and you have Unicode, leading to potential problems on Python 2. This occurs more rarely because (1) most of us are porting code from 2 → 2/3, not 3 → 2/3, and (2) Python 2 has various hacks to auto-encode Unicode into bytes when needed. However, if this problem does come up, functions analogous to those shown above can help."
