### HERA LST Aligner
#
# James Kent, University of Cambridge
# jck42@cam.ac.uk
#
# This script takes a directory of closure files outputted from recipe using
# heracasa (Bojan Nikolic, bn204@cam.ac.uk), and from there bins them so that
# closure measurements over successive days are aligned in LST.
#
# VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS. Plenty to do and tidy up...

class LST_Binner(object):

    """
    Class that takes the aligned LSTs and a dictionary of ALL the closures from
    all input days and concatenates them together and outputs them as a
    single numpy array.
    
    Attributes:

    lst_array     [Numpy array] This is an array of all aligned LSTS. We take the columns
                  of this to index {closure_dict} to get the closure phases for the 
                  correct LST.

    closure_dict  [Dictionary] Two-layer dictionary, keyed by date then by LST. 
                  Contains the closure phases as a [Numpy array] of shape 
                  (no_triads,no_channels).

    lst_start     [Integer] Column index for [lst_array] to output binned LST's from.

    lst_range     [Integer] Range of LST's to bin.

    triad_no      [Integer] Number of triads in closure phases in [closure_dict].

    channels      [Integer] Number of channels in closure phases in [closure_dict].

    day_array     [Numpy array] of shape (no_days). Gives UTC Dates.
    
    outlst_array  [Numpy array] of shape (no_lsts,no_days)Exact LST's of closures outputted.

    data_array    [Numpy array] of shape (no_lsts,no_days,no_triads,no_channels). Contains closures of shape.
