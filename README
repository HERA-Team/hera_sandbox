CAPO Notes:
Pasted from PAPER wiki Sep 12 2011
====== Calibration and Analysis of PAPER Observations (CAPO)======
CAPO is hosted as a repository on [[computing:shredder]]((Note that the head node address will occasionally change. As of this writing shredder's head node is folio.sas.upenn.edu.)) using [[http://git-scm.com/|git]]. This repository is meant to contain medium to well developed tools meant to be used on a project-wide basis.  Codes in development may be kept in personal files (eg capo/arp.py) or in subdirectories (eg capo/dcj/).  A tool or script need not be fully documented or tested for inclusion here //but no one will complain if it is.//

  import capo
