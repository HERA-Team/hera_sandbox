====== HERA Sandbox ======

This repository is meant to contain all miscellaneous individual code
being written as part of the HERA project.  Each person maintains
their own "sandbox" (usually a directory whose name is the 3-letter 
initials of the author).  A cardinal rule of this repo is to
not mess up others' sandboxes.  Some jointly-owned sandboxes may exist
for code that is being jointly developed.  

The expectation is that as code develops to a production level, it should be
migrated into HERA repos for production code: hera_cal, uvtools, hera_qm,
hera_rtp, hera_mc, etc.

Note that all code in the src/ directory is considered deprecated and should
not be edited.
