Descriptions of scripts on the rotation redundancy project. 
This project aims to determine the valuable pairs of baselines to correlate as the earth rotates during time of observation. 

Scripts:
Beamplay.py:  A simple scripts that plots the beam and the Fourier transform of the beam squared
antconfig.py: script that plots the configuration of the entire array. 
Rotation.py: plots tracks of the entire array as the earth rotates. 
Corrtime.py: Given two baselines, plots their correlation vs. time, or their differential UV track. Can also fix one baseline in time.
Pairing.py: The main script. Outputs informations on which data files to correlate, at what time, in order of inportance. Plots visualizations. 
 

Modules:
export_beam.py: module that contains beam related functions
select_pair.py: The main module, contains functions calle in Pairing.py. 
quick_sort.py: A quicksort algorithm specifically for the format of dictionaries in select_pair.py
plot_pair.py: plotting routines that plot closest approach points and pairings for a sample crossing

Output Files:
Pairing.out: result of Pairing.py, tells you which  pairs of data to correlate
