--------WATERFALL--------
PAPER flagging waterfall plots:
	waterfall.py contains the class that does work and can be run interactively
	wf.py is a command line script to run it
	jd_cal.py is included in the waterfall.py file to avoid moving it around with it

--------MISC--------
	jd_cal.py has some julian/calendar date conversion stuff
